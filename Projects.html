        <!-- Hospital Fiscal Report Analysis -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>Hospital Fiscal Report Analysis</h2>
            <p>Preprocessed unstructured and incomplete financial data across 100+ hospitals in California using Python (NumPy, Pandas) and Excel. 
            Developed and trained a Decision Tree Regressor (scikit-learn) to analyze fiscal trends, achieving actionable insights with a preliminary R² score of 0.71. 
            Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize hospital revenue trends, optimizing financial forecasting.</p>

        <!-- Rock Climbing Tracker App -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>Rock Climbing Tracker App</h2>
            <p>Developed a full-stack mobile app with React Native, TypeScript, & Expo, enabling users to log 100+ climbing sessions and dynamically track progress. 
            Integrated Firebase Firestore for real-time database storage and Firebase Authentication for secure user login. 
            Implemented GPS tracking via Expo Location API, achieving 95% accuracy for automatic location logging. 
            Built interactive data visualizations using react-native-chart-kit, helping users analyze climbing progress over 500+ climbs. 
            Integrated a linear regression model to predict climbing difficulty, achieving an R² score of 0.78 with an MSE of 1.25.</p>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>Line Regression Budgeting Program</h2>
            <p>Built a CRUD application with Python, SQLite, and Pandas to manage user expenses, automating data tracking and budget forecasting. 
            Predicted future expenses and incomes for a year with a preliminary R-squared of 0.5 using linear regression, identifying opportunities for further model improvement.</p>

        <!-- Reinforced Learning Reversi -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>Reinforced Learning Reversi</h2>
            <p>Developed an interactive Reversi game with Python, Pygame, OOP, and NumPy, featuring three modes: AI vs AI, AI vs Human, and Human vs Human. 
            Integrated reinforcement learning to improve AI decision-making, achieving a 30% increase in gameplay efficiency based on win rates against a baseline opponent. 
            Utilized hash maps to efficiently store and reference possible valid moves, reducing lookup time complexity to O(1) and improving AI speed.</p>
