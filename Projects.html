                    <p>https://github.com/Hichwan/BudgetProgram <br> Built a CRUD application with Python, SQLite, and Pandas to manage user expenses, automating data tracking, and budget forecasting. <br> Predicted future expenses and incomes for a year with a preliminary R-squared of 0.5 using linear regression, indicating opportunities for further model improvement.

                <li><a href ="https://github.com/Hichwan/Game-Reinforced-Learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinforced Learning Reversi</a></li>
                    <p>https://github.com/Hichwan/Game-Reinforced-Learning <br>Developed an interactive Reversi game with Python, Pygame, OOP, and Numpy featuring three modes: AI vs AI, AI vs Human, and Human vs Human.
                         <br> Integrated reinforcement learning to improve AI decision-making, achieving a 30% increase in gameplay efficiency based on measured win rates against a baseline opponent.
<br>Utilized hash maps to efficiently store and reference possible valid moves, reducing lookup time complexity to an average of O(1) and improving AI decision-making speed. </p>

                         <br> Developed and trained a Decision Tree Regressor (scikit-learn) to analyze fiscal trends, achieving actionable insights with a preliminary RÂ² score of 0.71.
                        <br> Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard allowing fiscal analysts to visualize and compare hospital revenue trends, optimizing financial forecasting. </p>
